# Deep Learning Regression and Classification of Tropical Cyclones based on HURSAT data

## Abstract
This study focuses on the application of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models for cyclone intensity estimation
and classification. Cyclones are one of the most
devastating natural disasters that cause significant loss of
life and property damage. Accurate and timely estimation
and classification of cyclones can help in effective disaster
management and mitigation. In this study, a CNN
Lenet architecture is used for classification and a proposed
CNN model is used for intensity estimation of cyclone
satellite images. The method involves pre-processing the
data, training the models on the dataset, and evaluating
the modelâ€™s performance. The results demonstrate that the
models achieve high accuracy in cyclone classification and
low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in cyclone intensity
estimation. This study provides insights into the potential
of CNN architecture, which can be beneficial in enhancing
disaster management strategies.
