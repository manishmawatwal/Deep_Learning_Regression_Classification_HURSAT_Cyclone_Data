# Deep Learning Regression and Classification of Tropical Cyclones based on HURSAT data

## Abstract
This study focuses on the application of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models for cyclone intensity estimation
and classification. Cyclones are one of the most
devastating natural disasters that cause significant loss of
life and property damage. Accurate and timely estimation
and classification of cyclones can help in effective disaster
management and mitigation. In this study, a CNN
Lenet architecture is used for classification and a proposed
CNN model is used for intensity estimation of cyclone
satellite images. The method involves pre-processing the
data, training the models on the dataset, and evaluating
the modelâ€™s performance. The results demonstrate that the
models achieve high accuracy in cyclone classification and
low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in cyclone intensity
estimation. This study provides insights into the potential
of CNN architecture, which can be beneficial in enhancing
disaster management strategies.

## Dataset
The HURSAT data project, managed by the National Centres
for Environmental Information (NCEI), captures infrared
satellite imagery of cyclones. This database stores
cyclone satellite images in NetCDF file format. The centre
of each cyclone was in the middle of each image. HURSATB1
data are derived from International Satellite Cloud Climatology
Project (ISCCP) B1 data. The HURSAT-B1
v06 data spans 1978-2015 and provides coverage of global
TCs at 8-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal resolution.
For this research, the data is taken from year
2001 to 2016. There were 14296, 6189, 195 images of
North Atlantic, North Pacific and North Indian ocean respectively.
The best track data is sourced from the HURDAT2
database, supplied by the National Hurricane Center
(NHC). This database comprehensively documents all identified
cyclones across various basins, including their wind
speeds recorded at 6-hour intervals. The best track data of
North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean were taken
from HURDAT2 database and the best track data of NIO is taken from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).
